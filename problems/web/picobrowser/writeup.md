# Change your browser agent

Probably the best way is to use some plugins in browser.

Actually just any way to change the user-agent field would be OK.

I am too lazy to do that right now, so just use plain good old `wget`

`wget --user-agent=picobrowser https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/50522/flag`

Then the HTML file contains the flag.
