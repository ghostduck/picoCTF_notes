# General Notes

- Use `cat` or `less` to read plaintext
- You may need to download and run programs from PicoCTF (hopefully no virus)

```bash
wget link_to_that_executable
chmod +x that_executable
./that_executable
```

- Display a Base64 string (if it can be shown as normal text):

```bash
echo "that base64 string" | base64 --decode

# Or use Python
echo  "some base64 string" | python3 -m base64 -d
```

- Find a file using `find`

```bash
# There are many properties that can be used with find
find files/ -name uber-secret.txt
```

- Watch out for extra newline character when passing strings via echo: (From question HashingJobApp)

```bash
$ echo -n "gachiBASS"  | md5sum  # This is parsing really just "gachiBASS"
21b1f2a39d204ea9ad743d6aff8c09c5  -
$ echo "gachiBASS" | md5sum   # This is parsing "gachiBASS\n", probably not what we want
cdea510f0c0bf87a7bd3ea7657162b41  -
```

- Flag format is like `picoCTF{something_longer_andmore}`
- The ASCII in number for "picoCTF{_}": 112 105 99 111 67 84 70 123 95 125

```python
s = "picoCTF{_}"
for c in s:
    print(ord(c), end=" ")
print()

```

- In Hex (not writing 0x): 70 69 63 6f 43 54 46 7b 5f 7d

- The above is for Big endian. When it is Little endian, the pattern for `pico` will be 6f 63 69 70

- If you have a byte plaintext file like `706963...` which is like the flag, you cat just pipe it to `xxd -r -p` to show its ASCII content.

```bash
$ cat flag.txt
7069636f43

$ cat flag.txt | xxd -r -p
picoC
```

- picoCTF is generous to open some servers/containers for us to play around with, connect to them using `ncat`

```bash
nc mercury.picoctf.net 22342
```

The output can be piped. From the question ["plumbing"](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/48?category=5&page=3)

```bash
nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 14291 | grep "picoCTF{"
```

- For shells without `cat` and `ls` (picoCTF 2023 Specialer)

Reference: <https://jarv.org/posts/cat-without-cat/>

We can still use Tabs to check for files/directories, or `echo *` to show file names (as `ls`).

Use `echo "$(<file.txt)"` as `cat file.txt`. Note that without the quotes(`""`) all newlines in the file will disappear.

> Explanation of this syntax: This syntax $(<file.txt) may look a bit strange, what you are doing is command substitution, where the contents of file.txt are sent to STDIN which is then echoâ€™d as STDOUT.

These can be useful in some very lightweight container environments.

- If I want to use some Python libraries to help to reduce manual works:

```bash
# setup venv
python3 -m venv env/picoCTF

# activate it
source env/picoCTF/bin/activate

# get the pwn module
pip install --upgrade pip  # Seems python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip # is ok too
python3 -m pip install wheel
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pwntools
```

- If I want to leave the virtual environment without ending terminal session

```bash
deactivate
```
